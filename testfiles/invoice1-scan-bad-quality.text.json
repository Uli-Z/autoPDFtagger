    "summary": "The document appears to be a scanned invoice of very poor quality. The OCR text is largely garbled, providing little usable data. The filename indicates it's an invoice (invoife1-scan-bad-quality.pdf) and the visible fragments include references to fax and invoice-related terms, but no clear date, amount, or issuer can be extracted. Overall, the document seems to be in a noisy state with unreliable content.",
