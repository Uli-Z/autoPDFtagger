    "summary": "A child's drawing showing two people standing in front of a mountain landscape. Across the sky is colorful, blocky handwriting that reads 'NÄCHSTES MAL KOMME ICH MIT' (Next time I will come with). The figures wear bright blue and red clothing, with green pants and red shoes, set against gray, jagged mountains. The scene conveys a hopeful message of joining or accompanying someone on a future trip.",
