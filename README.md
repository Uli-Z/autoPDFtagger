# autoPDFtagger

## Overview

autoPDFtagger is a Python tool designed for efficient home-office organization, focusing on digitizing and organizing both digital and paper-based documents. By automating the tagging of PDF files, including image-rich documents and scans of varying quality, it aims to streamline the organization of digital archives.

## Key Concepts

- **AI-Powered Tagging**: Leverages GPT-4 and GPT-Vision for fully automated tagging of PDFs, including intricate drawings and low-quality scans.
- **Focus**: Engineered for paperless home-office setups, prioritizing precise data analysis over complex UI.
- **Requirements**: Python environment and an OpenAI API key.
- **Functionalities**:
  - Robust text analysis powered by GPT.
  - Advanced image analysis utilizing GPT-Vision.
  - Utilizes existing metadata, file names, and folder structures.
  - Compiles information into a JSON database for easy access.
  - Standardizes file naming (YY-mm-dd-{TITLE}.pdf) and updates PDF metadata for efficient indexing.
  - Configurable to integrate other AI agents.
  - Future enhancements to refine folder organization.

## Concept and Context

In the advancing digital age, many documents are now delivered digitally, yet significant documents often still arrive in paper form. Looking towards a digital future, the consolidation of these documents into a unified digital archive becomes increasingly valuable. Simple scanning using smartphone cameras has made this practical. However, the reliability of existing OCR technologies and their limited ability to effectively index non-textual content like drawings or photos hampers the searchability of these documents. autoPDFtagger aims to bridge this gap by offering AI-assisted analysis and organization of PDF files, enhancing their searchability and organization with a level of precision comparable to human effort.

## Current Status
At the moment, there exists a functional prototype in the form of a terminal program with a Python module, which demonstrates its functionality and has already achieved impressive results for me. For a broader application, many detailed improvements are certainly necessary, especially in error handling and documentation.

## Caution and Considerations / Disclaimer

- **Data Privacy**: PDF content is transmitted to OpenAI servers for analysis. While OpenAI claims non-use of API inputs for training, sensitivity in handling private documents is advised.
- **Cost Control**: Be aware of the costs associated with OpenAI API usage, which is based on request volume. Analysis of a single page costs around 0.05 $.
- **Accuracy and Reliability**: This initial version is a proof-of-concept and may have limitations. It's designed to create copies rather than alter original files.
- **Metadata Editing**: Altering metadata could potentially invalidate certain documents. Be careful with digital signed documents.

## What you need to run this program
- Python
- An OpenAI-API-Key with access to _gpt-4-vision-preview model_
- Calculate Costs about 0.03 $ per image-processed PDF-Page

  -l, --list-incomplete
                        List incomplete documents
  -x, --filter-incomplete
                        Only apply action to incomplete documents
```

## Examples
Read all pdf files from a folder *pdf_archive* and store information in a JSON-database *files.json*:
```shell
$ autoPDFtagger pdf_archive -j files.json
```

Read a previous created JSON-database an do an AI-text-analysis, storing the results in a new JSON-file
```shell
$ autoPDFtagger files.json -t -j files2.json
```

Do an AI-image-analysis and tag-analyis on these files
```shell
$ autoPDFtagger files2.json -i -c -j files3.json
```

Copy the file to a new folder *new_archive* setting new metadata and assigning new filenames. The original folder structure remains unchanged.
```shell
$ autoPDFtagger files3.json -e new_archive
```

Do all the above steps in one command: 
```shell
$ autoPDFtagger pdf_archive -tic -e new_archive
```

## Random Technical Aspects / Dive Deeper If You Want

- In addition to the terminal program, a Python module autoPDFtagger is available for integration with other software. Check the code for the interface details.
- The analysis of files includes not just the filename but also the local file path relative to a base directory (Base-Directory). By default, when folders are specified, the respective folder is set as the base directory for all files down to the subfolders. In some cases, it may be sensible to manually set a different base directory.
- Metadata management uses a "confidence logic". This means data is only updated if the (estimated) certainty/confidence is higher than the existing data. This aims for incremental improvement of information but can sometimes lead to inconsistent results.
- The text analysis of documents in the current configuration is carried out with the help of gpt-3.5-turbo-1106. With a context window of 16k, even larger documents can be analyzed at an affordable price of under $0.01. In my tests, the quality has proven to be sufficient. Only for very short documents does gpt-4 seem to bring a significant benefit. Therefore, the program automatically uses gpt-4 for short texts (~100 words).
- Image analysis is the most time-consuming and expensive process, which is why the algorithm is also adjusted here. At the time of creation, only the gpt-4-vision-preview model exists. The current approach is to analyze only the first page for scanned documents. Subsequent pages are only analyzed if the relevant metadata could not be determined with sufficient confidence. A similar logic exists for digitally created PDFs, where contained images are only analyzed until the information quality is sufficient.
